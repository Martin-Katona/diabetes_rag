The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels through the release of adrenaline, noradrenaline, epinephrine, and other endogenous hormones. These regulatory mechanisms can be affected by smoking, leading to increased plasma free fatty acids, which may interfere with glucose uptake by cells.\n\nStudies have shown that elevated free fatty acids not only contribute to insulin resistance but also exacerbate T2DM. In addition, the imbalance between oxidative stress and insulin signaling can lead to endothelial dysfunction or inflammation, which might play a role in the development of cardiovascular diseases through the mechanism of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and insulin resistance.\n\nIn summary, smoking is linked to impaired insulin sensitivity due to autonomic disturbances and elevated free fatty acids. This combination not only increases the risk of developing T2DM but also exacerbates oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction or inflammation in the context of cardiovascular diseases through impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance.

        "rag_response": "Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, where the body's cells become less efficient at using insulin for glucose uptake. Smoking has been linked to higher concentrations of certain hormones, including adrenaline (cortisol), cortisol, and growth hormone antagonists. These compounds play a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels and interacting with key proteins involved in glucose metabolism. Moreover, oxidative stress and inflammation can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes by modulating various pathways within cells. Thus, smoking is recognized as another risk factor for Type 2 diabetes, contributing to its overall pathophysiology.",

        "rag_response": "Studies have indicated that smoking impairs insulin sensitivity, particularly among young men. In cross-sectional studies comparing smokers and nonsmokers, insulin sensitivity measures were found to be significantly lower (10-40%) in the smokers. This indicates a greater degree of insulin resistance compared to non-smokers.\nMoreover, it has been observed that smoking and nicotine use are associated with an increase in circulating levels of insulin-antagonistic hormones such as catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone, leading to changes in glucose metabolism. For instance, a study published by Eliasson et al28 found that the degree of insulin resistance was positively correlated with tobacco consumption and nicotine use.\nAdditionally, smoking has been shown to affect the autonomic nervous system through various mechanisms, potentially impairing insulin sensitivity or indirectly causing an increase in free fatty acids, which can interfere with glucose uptake.",

Compared to non-smokers, smokers display a significantly lower degree of insulin sensitivity, even after 8 weeks of cessation.\n\nCigarette smoking is associated with similar effects on plasma cotinine levels, other markers of cardiovascular disease risk, and the progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to those who quit smoking.
