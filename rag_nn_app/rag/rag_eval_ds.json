      "question": "What did a case-control study show about smoking and neuropathy in type 1 diabetic patients?",
      "expected_response": "In a case-control study, however, it was shown that the risk for neuropathy was 3 times higher in smoking type 1 diabetic patients than in nonsmokers."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did the London cohort of the WHO Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetics show about smoking and coronary heart disease?",
      "expected_response": "In the London cohort of the prospective (8-year follow-up) World Health Organization Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetics, it was shown that smoking is significantly associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), but not for stroke, in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study show about smoking and CHD in type 2 diabetic subjects?",
      "expected_response": "In type 2 diabetic subjects, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study clearly showed that cigarette smoking is a significant and independent risk factor for CHD."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did the Nurses’ Health Study show about smoking and mortality in diabetic women?",
      "expected_response": "In a recent analysis from the Nurses’ Health Study, a dose-effect relationship between smoking habits and mortality was shown. Thus, the risk for mortality from all causes is 1.64 in diabetic women who smoke 15 to 34 cigarettes per day, and 2.19 in women who smoke more than 34 cigarettes per day."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did a prospective study show about smoking cessation and mortality risk in diabetic patients?",
      "expected_response": "A relatively large prospective study analyzed the effects of smoking cessation on cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. Mortality risks in ex-smokers with diabetes were compared with risks for subjects who have never smoked. All-cause mortality risks were around 50% higher for patients who stopped smoking during the past 1 to 9 years and 25% higher in individuals who quit smoking before that, when compared with subjects who have never smoked."
  },
  {
      "question": "What are the main metabolic aberrations in type 2 diabetes?",
      "expected_response": "As pointed out earlier, insulin resistance in combination with a relative impairment in insulin secretion are the major metabolic defects in type 2 diabetes."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did studies show about smoking and insulin secretion?",
      "expected_response": "Studies published during recent years have not been able to show any significant aberrations in insulin secretion as an effect of cigarette smoking."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did studies show about smoking and insulin sensitivity?",
      "expected_response": "Contrary to this, a negative effect of smoking on insulin sensitivity has been documented in several studies."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did studies show about smoking and circulating levels of insulin-antagonistic hormones?",
      "expected_response": "Cigarette smoking and nicotine administration increase the circulating levels of insulin-antagonistic hormones (ie, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone)."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did studies show about smoking and free fatty acid levels?",
      "expected_response": "It has been well known for many years that smoking acutely elevates circulating free fatty acid levels."
  },
  {
      "question": "What did studies show about endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance?",
      "expected_response": "The potential role of endothelial dysfunction or inflammation for the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes has not yet been elucidated fully, although these have been found to be associated with insulin-resistant states such as prediabetes."
  },
  {
      "question": "What is the conclusion about tobacco use and diabetes?",
      "expected_response": "A high number of clinical and experimental studies and surveys give strong support for significant associations between tobacco use, the development of diabetes, glycemic control, and diabetic complications (micro- and macrovascular)."
